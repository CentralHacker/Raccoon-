# Raccoon-
Security Tool for Reconnaissance and Information Gathering

Raccoon made for observation and data gathering with an accentuation on effortlessness. 

It will do everything from bringing DNS records, recovering WHOIS data, acquiring TLS information, distinguishing WAF nearness and up to strung dir busting and subdomain identification. Each sweep yields to a comparing document. 

As the vast majority of Raccoon's sweeps are autonomous and don't depend on one another's outcomes, it uses Python's asyncio to run most outputs nonconcurrently.
